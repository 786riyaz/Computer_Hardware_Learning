## Additional Notes
- NVMe and M.2: NVMe is a protocol; M.2 is a slot. M.2 supports NVMe (PCIe) or SATA, with speeds varying by protocol and PCIe version.
- Video Ports: HDMI and DisplayPort are digital, primarily for video/audio, with bandwidth listed for context. VGA is analog, with no defined data rate.
- Practical Speeds: Theoretical maximums are rarely achieved due to protocol overhead, device limits, or cable quality.
- Cables: High resolutions require specific cables (e.g., Ultra High Speed HDMI for HDMI 2.1, DP80 for DP 2.0).
- Compression: DisplayPort’s DSC and HDMI 2.1’s FRL enable higher resolutions/refresh rates.
