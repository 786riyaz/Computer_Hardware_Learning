### Key Considerations
- **Socket Compatibility**: Match motherboard socket to CPU:
  - AMD: AM5 (Ryzen 7000+), AM4 (Ryzen 1000–5000), sTR5 (Threadripper).
  - Intel: LGA 1851 (Core Ultra 200), LGA 1700 (12th–14th Gen), LGA 2066 (Core X/Xeon W).
- **Chipset Tiers**:
  - **Z-Series (Intel Z890, Z790), X-Series (AMD X870E, Intel X299)**: Enthusiast, max PCIe lanes, overclocking.
  - **B-Series (AMD B850, Intel B860)**: Mid-range, cost-effective, limited/no overclocking.
  - **H-Series (Intel H810, H770), A-Series (AMD A620)**: Budget, no CPU overclocking, basic features.
  - **Q-Series (Intel Q870)**: Business/enterprise with management features.
- **Form Factor**: ATX (full-size), Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX (compact, fewer slots).
- **Future-Proofing**: AM5/LGA 1851 support PCIe 5.0, USB 4.0; AM4/LGA 1700 limited to DDR4 (optional DDR5), PCIe 4.0/5.0.
- **BIOS Updates**: Required for newer CPUs on older boards (check manufacturer CPU support lists).
- **Overclocking**: Avoid Intel H/Q-series, AMD A-series, or B840 for overclocking; prefer Z/X/B-series.
